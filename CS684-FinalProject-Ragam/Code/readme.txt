Project Description 
------------------- 
 
Our project aims at building a device which is capable of receiving music streamed from the very same wireless protocol at very low latency. 
We target the medium range Wi-Fi protocol (WLAN) for our work, and try to ensure that you do not loose your internet connection while listening 
to your favorite music on your device. 

Wired devices have to be connected through wires all the time and a small disruption in connection leads to unpleasant experience. 
Wireless solutions (like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) can be used to get rid of this issue.
