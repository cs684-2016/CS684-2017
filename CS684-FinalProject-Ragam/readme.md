Project Description:
Our project aims at building a device which is capable of receiving music streamed 
from the very same wireless protocol at very low latency. We target the medium range Wi-Fi protocol (WLAN) for 
our work, and try to ensure that you do not loose your internet connection while 
listening to your favorite music on your device. 

Wired devices have to be connected through wires all the time and a small disruption in connection 
leads to unpleasant experience. Wireless solutions (like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) can be used to get 
rid of this issue. There are cheap Bluetooth based music streaming devices available in the 
market, but they downsample the audio, which eventually reduces the audio quality.

We manage to create two different implementations for a Raspberry Pi device which can act as a 
server to music streaming from multiple sources on the client side. The client side can be Microsoft Windows, 
Android based device, Apple Devices (iPhone etc.). Music can be streamed from Windows devices, and 
Apple devices without any lag, using both implementations, although we face a very minute lag on 
Android devices. We aim to better our approach by writing native system based code for Linux based 
client side devices, thus expanding our range of client side device types.

We completed the work in stipulated time but not without some hiccups. There were a lot of challenges, and 
failures along the way, but we are successfully able to stream the audio from one device to another 
wirelessly, and in realtime.
